##### PhD Computer Science

Working on state of the art research in deep neural network model compression. Funding obtained from D-REAL - SFI (Centre for Research Training in Digitally-Enhanced Reality).


#### Centro de Investigación en Computación - IPN
##### Aug 2016 - Jun 2018
##### Master in Computer Science

Learned state of the art machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. Thesis work was done towards the computational relationships of group theory and natural languages.

#### Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez
##### Aug 2011 - May 2016
##### Bachelor in Mathematics

Learned a variety of methods to prove statements in different areas of mathematics. Optative course work was geared towards applied mathematics: optimization, probability theory, functional analysis, stochastic ODE, etc. Thesis was required for the degree, work was done in stochastic optimization.

#### Infolink-EXP.
##### Feb 2019 - Mar 2020
##### Lead Data Analyst

Applied ML to mine relevant information from our customers and integrate it to our platform called Zahoree. This platform is a customer journey modeling system, my contribution to the team is the processing of all our natural language sources (tickets, complaint emails, and reviews) and transform this data into information that is important for our customers business intelligence.

#### Indboo.
##### Jan 2018 - Jan 2019
##### Odoo Python Developer

Developed modules for Odoo (Open ERP) using Python, Javascript and PostgreSQL. The team used Agile Scrum and DevOps as the development methodology. Used docker and Git as version control. Started the job remotely. We modified Odoo to adjust it to our customers’ needs.
